# CustomGodot4.0.3
 The custom version of godot required to work on MaxQ
 First, follow build instructions: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html (Make sure you have 4.0.3), and compile for visual studio.
 You might need to use an older version of SCONS since at the time of writing the latest doesn't work (try first). When opening in visual studio, switch to x64.
 After building, drag the modules from the module branch into the built engine, and it should be ready after you compile.
